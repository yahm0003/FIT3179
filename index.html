        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Geographical Distribution of Expenditure</h2>
            <p>In Australia, New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria (VIC) have the highest healthcare expenditures,
                primarily due to their larger populations and urbanized regions that necessitate extensive healthcare
                services. Conversely, the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Northern Territory (NT), and Tasmania
                (TAS) exhibit the lowest healthcare expenditures, attributed to their smaller populations and, in the
                case of NT and TAS, geographic challenges that affect service access. This disparity underscores the
                need for tailored healthcare strategies to address the unique demands of these less populous regions.

            <h2>Expenditures Over Time</h2>
            <p>Medical services and public hospitals have consistently been the largest areas of healthcare expenditure
                in Australia over the years. This trend highlights their critical role in delivering essential
                healthcare services to the population. As demand for medical care and hospital facilities continues to
                grow, particularly in urban centers, funding for these sectors remains a priority. This sustained
                investment underscores the importance of accessible medical services and robust hospital systems in
                ensuring the health and well-being of Australians.</p>

            <h2>Breakdown by Funding Source</h2>
            <p>The majority of healthcare funding in Australia comes from the Australian Government, highlighting its
                pivotal role in supporting the healthcare system and ensuring access to essential services for the
                population. Following closely is the contribution from state and local governments, which supplement
                federal funding and address specific regional healthcare needs. Together, these sources of funding
                reflect a collaborative effort to maintain and enhance the quality of healthcare services across the
                country, ensuring that Australians receive the care they need.</p>
            <p>This breakdown provides insights into how different sectors contribute to overall healthcare spending in
                Australia.</p>

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2>Government Funding Allocation</h2>
            <p>Approximately two-thirds of healthcare funding in Australia comes from government contributions,
                highlighting the critical role of public funding in ensuring access to essential services. In contrast,
                one-third of funding is sourced from non-government sources, including private health insurance and
                out-of-pocket expenses. This balance underscores the mixed nature of Australiaâ€™s healthcare financing,
                allowing for a diverse range of services to meet the needs of the population.</p>
